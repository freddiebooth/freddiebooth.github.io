<p>Still, with so much choice offered, and with a lot lingo surrounding the subject of office telephones, it can be difficult to understand where to start. While Digital Phone Systems are useful and practical; they're not mobile. However, if your business must comply with security regulations that need information to be stored on-site, then a hosted solution is probably not the best service. The only difference in between Centrex and today's hosted phone systems (besides the lower expense of today's hosted systems) is that the Centrex systems ran over the traditional phone networks (the traditional phone lines) instead of the Internet (as holds true with a hosted VoIP system today).</p>
<p>Smaller businesses may discover that a hosted service provider does a better job of keeping information protected, mostly because of the devoted pool of resources the supplier invests in keeping all of their customers' data safe. Carefully consider how much the workaround will cost the company in the long term if you can not pay for brand-new phones. As a small or mid-sized  business, you will not need to worry about essential updates getting buried in your employees' inboxes, travelling for every single customer meeting, or missing out on important call.</p>
